# World_Weather_Analysis
This project is meant to help Jack use APIs to collect, analyze, and visualize data on weather in 500+ cities. This will help his clients figure out when and where to take their desired vacations.

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
In this section, 2000 random latitude an dlongitude coordinates are created. APIs are used to find nearby cities (if any) and collect weather data. This information was input into a dataframe and converted into a csv.

*Results are found in the Weather_Database Folder.*

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map


*Results are found in the Vacation_Search Folder.*

## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
